# Lessons

## 2026-06-03 GPU1 bootstrap

- AIStation development work for this repository is GPU1-only. GPU2 can be visible
  in the platform table, but experiment commands should bind to the GPU1 container
  and use `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` inside that container.
- Persistent experiment state belongs under `/huyang2/double-loop`; avoid `/root`,
  `/root/.cache`, and other reset-prone locations for environments, caches,
  artifacts, models, and run logs.
- Keep GitHub as the source of truth: run from a detached commit SHA on the GPU
  node, archive run metadata with that SHA, then commit and push tracking changes
  deliberately.
- The bitter lesson applies here: prioritize scalable search/training feedback and
  measured experiment loops over hand-built solver shortcuts.

## 2026-06-03 uv bootstrap

- GPU1's system Python can lack `ensurepip`/`python3-venv`, so `setup.sh` must
  bootstrap uv without requiring `python3 -m venv`. Prefer a local wheelhouse,
  then `pip --target` if pip exists, then the standalone uv installer into
  `/huyang2/double-loop/.cache/uv-bootstrap/bin`.
- The current GPU1 image already includes `/opt/conda/bin/python` with
  `torch 2.7.0+cu126` and CUDA on the A100. Reuse that configured GPU stack
  before downloading large torch wheels again.
- Avoid broad `pkill -f` process patterns. They can match the shell command that
  is trying to clean up the process and terminate the SSH session itself.
- Keep the experiment script syntactically valid on the reusable GPU Python
  stack. The current image uses Python 3.10, so avoid newer nested f-string
  syntax even if local tools can parse it.
- After remote patch transfer, inspect script tails and run the wrapper end to
  end. A syntactically valid shell script can still be semantically truncated
  before the metadata-recording step.
- Scale-up controls should be environment-driven in `run.sh`. Keeping model
  width/depth, curriculum, rollout, and optimizer knobs configurable lets GPU1
  runs increase useful compute without creating one-off wrapper scripts or
  broad low-signal sweep tables.
