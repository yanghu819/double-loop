## 2026-06-03 GPU1 bootstrap

- AIStation development work for this repository is GPU1-only. GPU2 can be visible
  in the platform table, but experiment commands should bind to the GPU1 container
  and use `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` inside that container.
- Persistent experiment state belongs under `/huyang2/double-loop`; avoid `/root`,
  `/root/.cache`, and other reset-prone locations for environments, caches,
  artifacts, models, and run logs.
- Keep GitHub as the source of truth: run from a detached commit SHA on the GPU
  node, archive run metadata with that SHA, then commit and push tracking changes
  deliberately.
- The bitter lesson applies here: prioritize scalable search/training feedback and
  measured experiment loops over hand-built solver shortcuts.
